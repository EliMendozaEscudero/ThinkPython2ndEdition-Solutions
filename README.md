# ThinkPython2ndEdition-Solutions

This repository is a set of solutions that I wrote to solve the proposed exercises at  [Think python 2nd edition](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/). 
## Purpose: 
I tried to make it helpful for the reader who couldn't find a solution for some exercise in the book and is looking for inspiration to find their own solution.
