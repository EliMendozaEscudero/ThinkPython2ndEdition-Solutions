# ThinkPython2ndEdition-Solutions

This repository is a set of solutions that I wrote to solve the proposed exercises at  [Think pythhon 2e](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/). It pretends to be helpful for the reader who couldn't find a solution for some of the exercises in the book and needs inspiration to find their own solution.
